# Quiz-App

- Building Quiz app
- Could use an API to grab the questions from it
- Screen starts on the first question.
- Currently i'll start with just one html page, but im sure I could use multiple, one for each question, and when clicking next,
it should move on unto the next page.



- 4 options to select from.
- If I click on correct option in turns green.
- If I click in incorrect option in turns red but I also get to see in green which one was the correct answer.
- With a next button I can move unto the next question.
- In the last screen after answering the questions It should tell me how many i got right.
- In that same last screen there will be a button that says play again.
- once that button is clicked I can take the quiz again.
